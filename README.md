This program is a randomizer for the game Hades by SuperGiantGames: https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/

This program was mostly just a fun project to do on a lazy afternoon. The code was written by some friends and I, the former of which you can find at:

Idea came from:

To run the randomizer either download the file and run it using Python, or visit https://repl.it/@nickgoris/Hades-Randomizer to run it in an online shell

If you have any suggestions or notice some mistakes/bugs, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request!

Current roadmap:
- Building it into a website
- Try and balance PoP choices
- Insert a way for players to lock in PoP choices before randomising the rest
- A GUI?
